      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I am a public accounting professional with extensive experience in corporate, trust, and personal tax compliance, as well as financial reporting, review, and audit engagements. Skilled in tools such as CaseWare, CaseView, and TaxPrep, I prepare and review working papers, reconcile complex accounts, and manage investment and foreign currency transactions. I’ve developed a strong ability to navigate CRA audits, address compliance requirements, and communicate clearly with clients to deliver accurate, timely results. Having successfully written the CFE in 2023, I am progressing toward my CPA designation while continuing to grow my technical expertise and client advisory skills.</p>
